# GDP 1 & 2 Course Outlines

<!-- Calculating available time & unit lengths:

180 days / year - (days lost to testing or other planned dissruptions)
 90 days / semester (more disurptions in second semester)
 10 days / block cycle
  9 block cycles = 6:49 / cycle * 9 = 61:20 of class time (bell to bell)
 45 class meetings / semester

### Level 1: Critical Thinking About Games

* Theories of game "purpose" and game criticism

* Canvas skills
* File management
* Typing proficiency assessment

#### Topics / Resources

Several games to play and discuss in terms of fun, engagement, and message.

* Jane McGonigal - Games to Change the World
* Brenda Romero
* ZoÃ« Quinn - The game I had to write
* Keith Burgun - What makes a game?
* Ian Bogost - Play Anything
* Jeremy Gibson Bond - Layared Tetrad
* MDA

#### Summative Assessment

A critique of a game that was created with a clear purpose in mind, using a thoretical framework and "industry standard" vocabulary.

### Level 2: The Design Process

Design Process & Paper Prototyping

Work in assigned groups of 3 or 4 - groups are diverse in terms of grade level and GPA range.

#### Objectives

* Use the design process to explore & refine ideas as you create a prototype to show to your client.
  - Client presents a game design request to explore a situation.

#### Summative Assessment

Whole class works on one problem (design challenge)

**Choices:**

* Type: Contest, Puzzle, Simulation, Game
* Style:
  - Race To the Finish

#### Collaboration Tools:

* Google Suite

### Level 3: Digital Games & Digital Tools

* Game Engine Overview

  Focus on the way the choice of a game engine defines the game by impacting the interactions and mechanics that are supported. For this reason we're going to look at Unity, but not Unreal or GameMaker since they are in more or less the same niche as Unity. Some of the game engines that we will look at in our survey are:

  - Unity - Physics / action
  - Twine - Interactive Fiction (IF)


* Other Tools
  - Audacity
  - Piskel / Photoshop
  - Blender

* Unity: Playground Project


#### Summative Assessment

### Level 4: Semester Project

#### Summative Assessment

## GDP-2

* Unit 5: Programming for Designers
* Unit 6: Unity Foundations
* Unit 7: Advanced Unity
* Unit 8: Final Project
