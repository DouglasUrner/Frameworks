## Unit 0: Baseline

* Notebooks
  - Notebook score and rubric card
    - Develop rubric
    - Design card
    - Lesson & Canvas page
* Syllabus
  - Paper / Intro statement for Canvas
  - Assessment
    - Masterable sub-components of the "big item" (at any given point you could predict the final grade by the proportion of the big items that were done compared to the point in the course - calculus). By assessing masterable sub-components the current grades should be reasonable predicters of the outcome of the course.
    - Formative
    - Summative
    - Reassessment / Grade improvement
    - Due dates
* Baseline Assessments - identify 8th grade competencies that the course depends on (which will have to be taught) and those that "would be nice to have" (for example proficient typing) that students can work on independently and use as evidence of self-directed learning.
