# Level 0: Basic Skills Assessment

## Objective

Assess foundational computer, collaboration, communication, and project management skills. Precisely following written directions.

* Identify leaders
* Select teams for next unit

## Summative Assessment

Team assessmont: everyone on the team should have the basic checklist completed to a high level of accuracy. As a whole the team should have members who can do most of the skills and everybody should know who the experts are. Members of other teams may be consultants (and charge fees), teacher is the ultimate (and very expensive consultant).

Maybe gamify it by using Monopoly money. No charge within team, consultants can charge fees (which may drive teams to learn skills on own) - each team has a goal that earns them revenue, team with the most revenue (earnings minus fees to consultants) is the winner.

New teams interview for member skills. Failing teams can get shut down (disbanded and not allowed to reform). "Dream teams" have higher expectations and burn rates.

* Begin: look at a rubric / practice test and see where the team is at.
* Goals: (have point values attached to skills) maximize team score – pick most important goals and make the most progress towards them.
* Finish: Computer accounts and notebooks set up, rubrics accurately assessed.
