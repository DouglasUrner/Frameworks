## Progression of Git usage / skills

* Create A Repository (GitHub Pages site)
* Document Plans ()
* Blog
* Fork / Pull Request
* Branch / Merge
* Issues

## Making assessment value growth

* Identify the growth path in the curriculm (what are the big ideas/concepts that you want to see growth in).
* Identify essential knowledge, tasks, and understandings (conceptal grasp).
* Identify scaffolding - how do you build the capacity to do deeper work (climbing a ladder).
* Identify "levels" and a way to assess starting points.
* Make an assessment matrix.
* Have concrete tasks that real people do regularly in the field - assign work that mimics these tasks.
* Create lessons & assingments around completing those tasks.
* Require collabarative work / teach team and self-assessment. Focus assessment on growth. What can you do now that you couldn't do before? What do you understand now that you didn't understand when we started? (Blog entries)

## What we do:

* Design experiences (design process)
* Project management
* Software development
*

## Git & GitHub Skills Development
1. Create accounts
2. Hello World
3. Knife-Spoon

Algorithms - challenge scaled by ruberic:
- NY: (high) notes and an attempt, but unable to create a complete/working implementation, or needing substantial assisstance.
- AP: Use exactly what was presented (reproduce examples from class, high end score if done from notes and/or without assistance)
- PR: Combine
- EX: Discover new (research); develop tests

Use docs [SDL]

Groups discuss and take notes, assessment is based on individual task supported by discussion. NY and AP scores come from tracking the discussion and asking clarifying questions. Score group discussion by looking at whole team's notes for evidence of collaboration and mutual support.

Score based on evidence presented, not on evidence missing.

Use GH wiki

## GDP-1 Unit Ideas & Sequence

<!-- Calculating available time & unit lengths:

180 days / year - (days lost to testing or other planned dissruptions)
 90 days / semester (more disurptions in second semester)
 10 days / block cycle
  9 block cycles = 6:49 / cycle * 9 = 61:20 of class time (bell to bell)
 45 class meetings / semester
-->

* Unit 1: Critical Thinking About Games (September / February)
* Unit 2: The Design Process (October / March)
* Unit 3: Digital Games & Digital Tools (November / April)
* Unit 4: Final Project (December-January / May-June)

## GDP-2 Unit Ideas & Sequence

* Unit 5: Programming for Designers
* Unit 6: Unity Foundations
* Unit 7: Advanced Unity
* Unit 8: Final Project

## Unit Structure

* Objectives
* Developing Collaboration & Leadership Skills
* Career Exploration
* Summative Assessment
* Design Practices Introduced & Reinforced
* Tools

## Unit 1 -

Design Process & Paper Prototyping

Work in assigned groups of 3 or 4 - groups are diverse in terms of grade level and GPA range.

### Objectives

* Use the design process to explore & refine ideas as you create a prototype to show to your client.
  - Client presents a game design request to explore a situation.

### Summative Assessment

Whole class works on one problem (design challenge)

**Choices:**

* Type: Contest, Puzzle, Simulation, Game
* Style:
  - Race To the Finish

### Collaboration Tools:

* Google Suite

# 2018.05.25

People are natural patern seekers - John Medina (increasing cognative engagement)

Practice recognizing patterns, patterns are a foothold for constructing algorithms.

## Pattern Exercises

* https://brilliant.org
* https://brilliant.org/practice/pattern-recognition-intro/?subtopic=pattern-recognition

# 2018.05.24

Display for each project - [Leadership, Communicating comutational ideas]

Feedback as part of evidence on each project [Evidence of Application of the design cycle]
- Publication
- Cite feedback that influenced your design, coding, or testing
- Plan for what you were going to do
- Implementation and evidence of result

Working in Diverse Teams - Roles [Leadership]

Master rubric for each assignment

Reassessment requires evidence of remedial associations

Summative assessment, build cycle, weight heavy on recent assingments

Review rubric and investigate, mentor works, exemplars

Case studies - examples of real games that illustrate the summative assessment on each unit

## Big Rubric

Add examples of real world, non-CS tasks / behaviors at each level.

What each score means:

-   0 : NE (F or NC) no evidence at all, assignment not turned in
-   1 : NE (F or NC) evidence is insufficient to make a determination
-   2 : NY (D) With direct guidence (assignment builds fountation)
- 3-4 : AP (C) With structure and some guidence
- 5-6 : PR (B) Independently - extracting transferable KSU (use on new similar projects)
- 7-8 : EX (A) Independently - developing new, untaught, KSU (discover and solve new problems or applications)

## Grade expectations:

C - do what you are told "I'm done" (not being a self-directed learner)

B - exploring (in bounds)

A - expanding

## Game Concept Policy

Games played, critiqued, and developed in class *must* be school appropriate. Specifically this means that games with mechanics built around violence (especially gratuitious violence), games with explicit sexual content, games which sterotype individuals or groups, are not apporpriate - and they will not be accepted for any assignment. If you wonder if your idea might fall into the forbidden category ask *first* so that you don't waste time.

Game industry ratings (e.g., [ESRB][])- use one as the break point. Teach the ratings as an entry point and use content as a launching point for a discussion of what makes games fun to play vs. interesting (e.g., what is the draw of violence in games and other entertainment media).

Also use this as a launching point for a discussion of abstraction and modeling - consider games that are (or can be read as being) explicity about war and conflict and which do not include any explicit violence, for example Chess, Go, Risk, Stratego).

## Grouping

Girls together near teacher station for first seating chart.

Assign groups across grade levels, try for range of GPAs.

Seat groups together, responsibile as a for the care of the area.
- Check on arriving
- Monitor during class
- Leave as good or better than you found it
- Help each other stay on task and meet growth goals

## Scenario

Apprentice developers

Something has happened - all of the game developers have vanished and the world is left with some old nerds, artifacts, and the desire to start creating games again.

Starting point of critique of the "old" gaming culture.

## Outside Mentors

Publish online so that we can get critiques from "real" clients - real client critiques earn more points.

## Summer Project

Design our own games:
- Paper prototype
- Digital prototypes
- Look at tools for custom components

## Summative Assessments

* Polished and playtested prototype
* Critique of an apporprate game
* Digital prototype
* Career profile
* Project plan
* Portfolio
  - Designer's statement
  - Review of a game
  - Review of a tool
  - Blog posts
  - Game prototype
  - Resume

## Cheat Sheets

Require a binder (with some kind of assessment)

Provide a "cheat sheet" for each unit as well as rubrics.

## GDP 1

1st quarter: big ideas, background with quick proctice projects.
2nd quarter: short and long team projects - with departments.

Computers as problem sorving tools in a variety of disciplines.
Games as projects that are tackled by diverse teams with a variety of skillsets.
"Games" can be applied to many problems.

Working it teams

Final project choices:
- **Design** of a new game.
- Specify and select art for an existing prototype
- Code related project

Fourdational computer skillset
Overview of industry and use of skills from class
The process of creating a game
Algorithms
Abstraction
Familiarity with C# code:
- The workings of computers and the role of code
- Syntax, what it  looks like

Is design for me?
Is CS for me?
Would I like to work in the GD industry?
How might these skills apply to careers that I'm interested in?
