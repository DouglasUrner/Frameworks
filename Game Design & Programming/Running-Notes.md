Display for each project - [Leadership, Communicating comutational ideas]

Feedback as part of evidence on each project [Evidence of Application of the design cycle]
- Publication
- Cite feedback that influenced your design, coding, or testing
- Plan for what you were going to do
- Implementation and evidence of result

Working in Diverse Teams - Roles [Leadership]

Master rubric for each assignment

Reassessment requires evidence of remedial associations

Summative assessment, build cycle, weight heavy on recent assingments

Review rubric and investigate, mentor works, exemplars

Case studies - examples of real games that illustrate the summative assessment on each unit

## Big Rubric

Add examples of real world, non-CS tasks / behaviors at each level.

What each score means:

-   0 : NE (F or NC) no evidence at all, assignment not turned in
-   1 : NE (F or NC) evidence is insufficient to make a determination
-   2 : NY (D) With direct guidence (assignment builds fountation)
- 3-4 : AP (C) With structure and some guidence
- 5-6 : PR (B) Independently - extracting transferable KSU (use on new similar projects)
- 7-8 : EX (A) Independently - developing new, untaught, KSU (discover and solve new problems or applications)

## Grade expectations:

C - do what you are told "I'm done" (not being a self-directed learner)

B - exploring (in bounds)

A - expanding

## Game Concept Policy

Games played, critiqued, and developed in class *must* be school appropriate. Specifically this means that games with mechanics built around violence (especially gratuitious violence), games with explicit sexual content, games which sterotype individuals or groups, are not apporpriate - and they will not be accepted for any assignment. If you wonder if your idea might fall into the forbidden category ask *first* so that you don't waste time.

Game industry ratings (e.g., [ESRB][])- use one as the break point. Teach the ratings as an entry point and use content as a launching point for a discussion of what makes games fun to play vs. interesting (e.g., what is the draw of violence in games and other entertainment media).

Also use this as a launching point for a discussion of abstraction and modeling - consider games that are (or can be read as being) explicity about war and conflict and which do not include any explicit violence, for example Chess, Go, Risk, Stratego).

## Grouping

Girls together near teacher station for first seating chart.

Assign groups across grade levels, try for range of GPAs.

Seat groups together, responsibile as a for the care of the area.
- Check on arriving
- Monitor during class
- Leave as good or better than you found it
- Help each other stay on task and meet growth goals

## Scenario

Apprentice developers

Something has happened - all of the game developers have vanished and the world is left with some old nerds, artifacts, and the desire to start creating games again.

Starting point of critique of the "old" gaming culture.

## Outside Mentors

Publish online so that we can get critiques from "real" clients - real client critiques earn more points.

## Summer Project

Design our own games:
- Paper prototype
- Digital prototypes
- Look at tools for custom components

## Summative Assessments

* Polished and playtested prototype
* Critique of an apporprate game
* Digital prototype
* Career profile
* Project plan
* Portfolio
  - Designer's statement
  - Review of a game
  - Review of a tool
  - Blog posts
  - Game prototype
  - Resume

## Cheat Sheets

Require a binder (with some kind of assessment)

Provide a "cheat sheet" for each unit as well as rubrics.
