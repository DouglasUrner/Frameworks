## Unit 1: Critical Thinking About Games (Blocks: 5; Hours: h m)

Begin developing a critical framework and vocabulary for analyzing games. We will also begin to develop our skills as _playtesters_ as we investigate the properties of some simple games.

What are we saying when we call something a _game_? What makes a game "fun" and engaging? How can we clearly communicate our ides about games with other game developers?

>Handout to go in notebook outlining playtest process. Hand out and have students tape into notebooks after 1st playtest. Review, identify and name steps. Practice recording the results.

Do three or four rounds of playtests:
1. (I) Guided with interspersed discussion.
2. (W) Guiding process (grade for accurately following process steps and taking notes)
3. (Y) Practice
4. (Y) Summative

Playtests:
* Well defined short game.
* Specific questions that direct students to think about specific qualities of the game under test.
* Anticipate responses.
* Specific options for expected responses.

## Components & Assessments

### Performance Assessments

* Use of a sprite editing tool to create game characters and objects.
* Use of audio editing software to create sound effects.
* Adding the assets to a game.
* Design of tvo characters:

  "Walk a mile in their shoes." Have a collection of source materials for the experiences of different groups. Migration stories, history of people in our community. Another source could be heretical scientists (or just groundbreaking scientists).

  Start with "your people" - strengths, challenges, sterotypes (what's true, what distorted), how are they portrayed in entertainment media.

  - You: a realistic you with a "better you" power and a "fatal flaw."
  - The person you don't know.

  Post anonymously for critique (person doing the critique doesn't know whose characters they are reviewing), share names after critique so that the critiquer is accountable and the the creator can ask questions.
* Audio or sprites for one (both?) of the characters.

# Level 0: Foundations of Game Design

* Duration: 3-5 blocks

## Objective

Assess foundational computer, collaboration, communication, and project management skills. Precisely following written directions.

* Identify leaders
* Assess foundational skills
* Develop note taking skills
*

Use results to select teams for next unit.

## Summative Assessment

Team assessmont: everyone on the team should have the basic checklist completed to a high level of accuracy. As a whole the team should have members who can do most of the skills and everybody should know who the experts are. Members of other teams may be consultants (and charge fees), teacher is the ultimate (and very expensive consultant).

Maybe gamify it by using Monopoly money. No charge within team, consultants can charge fees (which may drive teams to learn skills on own) - each team has a goal that earns them revenue, team with the most revenue (earnings minus fees to consultants) is the winner.

New teams interview for member skills. Failing teams can get shut down (disbanded and not allowed to reform). "Dream teams" have higher expectations and burn rates.

* Begin: look at a rubric / practice test and see where the team is at.
* Goals: (have point values attached to skills) maximize team score – pick most important goals and make the most progress towards them.
* Finish: Computer accounts and notebooks set up, rubrics accurately assessed.
  - Notebook
  - Class folder
    - On U: drive
    - Named according to convention (value (_Block N - GDP_) and reference (_class folder_))
    - Unit folders (named by convention)
  - Accounts
    - SKSD / Google
    - Personal e-mail
    - Canvas
    - GitHub
  - Attention to detail
    - Spelling, capitalization, punctuation
    - Close reading of rubrics and instructions
  - Accurate use of vocabulary
