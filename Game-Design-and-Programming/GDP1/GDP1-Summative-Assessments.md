## Unit 1: Critical Thinking About Games

* **Task:** Select a game that intends to have a positive impact on the world and make a critique of it. The critique should be written to an audience of game deelopers interested in creating interactive experiences intended to make a positive impact on the world – use vocabulary and a conceptual framework apporpriate to your audience.

* **Driving Question:** How do we create games that have a positive impact on their players and the world? As we look at this question we'll be asking ourselves:
  - What is a game?
  - What are the qualities of an engaging game?
  - How do games impact the world?
  - Can we design games with intention?
  - How can we tell if the actually work?

## Unit 2: Design & Prototyping

* **Task:** Design, playtest (at least two iterations), a paper prototype of a game that can be played by two players (more is ok, but it must work with two). The prototype must be a game that intends to give the players a glimpse into the life or experience of another person or group of people.

  >The prompt for the summative assessment should lead to a game that can fairly obviously be prototyped in the Playground Project toolkit.

* **Driving Question:** How do you find ideas for games and turn them into designs with a playable prototypes?

## Unit 3: Digital Tools

* **Task:**

* **Driving Question:** How do we turn a design and paper prototype for a game into a digital prototype?

## Final Project: Digital Game Prototype

All core standards are assessed.

* **Task:**

* **Driving Question:** How game developers tackle big projects and collaborate to get them done?
