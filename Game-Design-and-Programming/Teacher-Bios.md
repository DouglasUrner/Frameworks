How computers, devices, and ubiqutous high-speed networks (i.e., the Internet) are changin the world. I'm particularly interested in the abilities of young people as software developers and the way games are changing -- for better and for worse.

I started programming in high school, in a school that had only one computer available to students. The first college I went to also had only one computer for general use (but several people could use it at once). One of my first progamming projects was a program to play the game Go. More than not I've been programming ever since.

In the course of my career I've learned over 20 programming lanugages well enough to solve problems in them of those I know maybe 5 or 6 well enough to use to tackle arbitrary tasks. I've worked with (and on) 8 major operating systems – and a few computers that didn't have an OS.
